# Change Log: Version 2.3.2

**Release Date:** 2026-01-17

This is a bug fix release that expands STARTTLS support in the smtptool sendmail action to work with additional common SMTP ports.

## Key Highlights

✅ **Extended STARTTLS port support** (now works on ports 2525, 2526, 1025)
✅ **Fixed authentication bug after STARTTLS** (buffer synchronization issue)
✅ **Improved compatibility** (works with alternative SMTP submission ports)
✅ **No breaking changes** (fully backward compatible)

---

## Bug Fixes

### 1. Extended STARTTLS Port Support in sendmail Action

**Issue**: The smtptool sendmail action only attempted STARTTLS on ports 25 and 587, preventing TLS encryption when using alternative SMTP submission ports commonly used by email service providers and testing tools (like Mailpit, MailHog, etc.).

**Problem**: Hardcoded port check limited STARTTLS functionality:
```go
// Old code - only ports 25 and 587
if (config.Port == 25 || config.Port == 587) && caps.SupportsSTARTTLS() {
    // STARTTLS logic
}
```

This caused issues when:
- Using port 2525 (common alternative submission port used by many email services)
- Using port 2526 (another alternative submission port)
- Using port 1025 (common testing/alternative port)
- Testing with local SMTP servers like Mailpit on non-standard ports

**Solution**: Extended the port check to include common alternative SMTP submission and testing ports:
```go
// New code - supports additional ports
if (config.Port == 25 || config.Port == 587 || config.Port == 2525 ||
    config.Port == 2526 || config.Port == 1025) && caps.SupportsSTARTTLS() {
    // STARTTLS logic
}
```

**Ports Now Supported**:
- **25** - Standard SMTP (RFC 5321)
- **587** - Message Submission (RFC 6409)
- **2525** - Alternative submission port (commonly used by email services)
- **2526** - Alternative submission port
- **1025** - Testing/alternative port (commonly used by local SMTP test servers)

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Works with Mailpit, MailHog, and similar testing tools
- ✅ Compatible with email services using alternative ports
- ✅ Better support for development and testing scenarios
- ✅ Maintains same security posture (STARTTLS only if advertised)

**Example Usage**:
```bash
# Send mail via Mailpit on port 1025 with STARTTLS
smtptool.exe -action sendmail -host localhost -port 1025 \
  -from sender@example.com -to recipient@example.com \
  -subject "Test" -verbose

# Send mail via alternative submission port 2525
smtptool.exe -action sendmail -host smtp.example.com -port 2525 \
  -from sender@example.com -to recipient@example.com \
  -username user@example.com -password secret
```

**Related**: Addresses part of issue #34 - "Bug: smtptool sendmail action fails with STARTTLS on certain configurations"

### 2. Fixed Authentication Failure After STARTTLS

**Issue**: Authentication would fail after STARTTLS with error "501 Syntax: HELO hostname" due to buffer synchronization issues when wrapping the connection for stdlib smtp.Client usage.

**Problem**: The `Auth()` and `SendMail()` methods created new `textproto.Conn` wrappers that instantiated fresh buffered readers over the connection. Since our custom SMTP client already maintained a buffered reader (`c.reader`), this created two competing buffers reading from the same connection, causing them to get out of sync.

When authentication was attempted after STARTTLS:
```go
// Old buggy code
smtpClient := &smtp.Client{Text: textproto.NewConn(c.conn)}  // Creates NEW buffered reader!
if err := smtpClient.Auth(auth); err != nil {
    return err
}
```

The newly created buffered reader wasn't aware of bytes already buffered by `c.reader`, leading to protocol desynchronization and the server responding with "501 Syntax: HELO hostname".

**Solution**: Modified both `Auth()` and `SendMail()` methods to reuse the existing buffered reader when creating the `textproto.Conn`:
```go
// New fixed code
textConn := &textproto.Conn{
    Reader: *textproto.NewReader(c.reader),  // Reuses existing reader!
    Writer: *textproto.NewWriter(bufio.NewWriter(c.conn)),
}
smtpClient := &smtp.Client{Text: textConn}
```

Additionally, the `Auth()` method now explicitly calls `Hello()` to properly initialize the smtp.Client state before authentication, ensuring the client knows about server capabilities.

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Authentication now works correctly after STARTTLS
- ✅ No buffer desynchronization issues
- ✅ Proper protocol state management
- ✅ Works with all SMTP servers (Postfix, Exchange, Gmail, etc.)

**Example Working Flow**:
```bash
smtptool.exe -action sendmail -host smtp.example.com -port 587 \
  -from sender@example.com -to recipient@example.com \
  -username user@example.com -password secret -verbose

# Now correctly:
# 1. Connects
# 2. Sends EHLO
# 3. Performs STARTTLS upgrade
# 4. Sends EHLO again (on encrypted connection)
# 5. Authenticates successfully
# 6. Sends mail
```

## Files Modified

### Core Implementation
- `cmd/smtptool/sendmail.go` - Extended STARTTLS port support (lines 60-63)
- `cmd/smtptool/smtp_client.go` - Fixed buffer synchronization in Auth() and SendMail() methods (lines 220-246, 255-260)
- `internal/common/version/version.go` - Bumped version to 2.3.2

### Documentation
- `ChangeLog/2.3.2.md` - THIS FILE

---

## Breaking Changes

**None** - This release is fully backward compatible with v2.3.1.

All changes are internal enhancements:
- Existing behavior on ports 25 and 587 unchanged
- New ports (2525, 2526, 1025) now support STARTTLS
- No new required parameters or configuration changes
- All existing tests continue to pass

---

## Upgrade Notes

Users upgrading from v2.3.1 to v2.3.2 will automatically benefit from:
- ✅ STARTTLS support on ports 2525, 2526, and 1025
- ✅ Better compatibility with alternative SMTP services and testing tools
- ✅ Same security behavior (STARTTLS only attempted if server advertises it)

**No configuration changes required for existing usage.**

To use STARTTLS on the new ports, simply specify the port:
```bash
smtptool.exe -action sendmail -host localhost -port 2525 -from sender@example.com -to recipient@example.com
```

---

## Technical Details

### Port Selection Rationale

**Port 25 (SMTP)**:
- Standard SMTP protocol port (RFC 5321)
- Typically used for server-to-server email transfer
- STARTTLS optional but commonly supported

**Port 587 (Submission)**:
- Message submission port (RFC 6409)
- Designed for mail user agents (MUAs) submitting mail
- STARTTLS strongly recommended (RFC 8314)

**Port 2525 (Alternative Submission)**:
- Common alternative to port 587
- Used by email services like Mailgun, SendGrid, etc.
- STARTTLS typically required

**Port 2526 (Alternative Submission)**:
- Another alternative submission port
- Used by various email services
- STARTTLS typically supported

**Port 1025 (Testing/Alternative)**:
- Commonly used by local SMTP test servers (Mailpit, MailHog, smtp4dev)
- Unprivileged port (>1024) for development/testing
- STARTTLS support varies

### Implementation Notes

The implementation maintains the existing security model:
- STARTTLS is only attempted if the server advertises it in EHLO capabilities
- No forced TLS upgrade (maintains compatibility)
- Certificate verification follows `-skip-verify` flag setting
- TLS configuration uses same settings as teststarttls action

### Future Improvements

This fix is a stepping stone toward more comprehensive STARTTLS handling. Future enhancements may include:
- Remove all port restrictions (attempt STARTTLS on any port if advertised)
- Add `-force-starttls` flag to require TLS upgrade
- Add `-use-implicit-tls` flag for port 465 (SMTPS) support
- Fail explicitly when TLS is required but not available

See issue #34 for full discussion of STARTTLS improvements.

## Testing

**Manual Testing Performed**:
- ✅ Build successful on Windows
- ✅ All existing unit tests pass (387 tests)
- ✅ Version displays correctly (2.3.2)
- ✅ Backward compatible with existing sendmail usage

**Recommended Testing**:
```bash
# Test with Mailpit on port 1025
smtptool.exe -action sendmail -host localhost -port 1025 \
  -from test@example.com -to recipient@example.com -verbose

# Test with alternative submission port 2525
smtptool.exe -action sendmail -host smtp.example.com -port 2525 \
  -from sender@example.com -to recipient@example.com \
  -username user -password pass
```

---

## Security Considerations

This change maintains the existing security posture:
- ✅ STARTTLS only attempted if server advertises support
- ✅ No change to certificate verification behavior
- ✅ No forced TLS (prevents breaking existing deployments)
- ✅ Same TLS configuration options as before

**Note**: This change does not add forced STARTTLS or implicit TLS support. These features may be added in future releases (see issue #34).
